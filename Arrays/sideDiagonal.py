# Given an integer n, create a two-dimensional array of size (nÃ—n) and populate it as follows, with spaces between each character:

#    The positions on the minor diagonal (from the upper right to the lower left corner) receive 1 .
#    The positions above this diagonal recieve 0 .
#    The positions below the diagonal receive 2 . 

# Print the elements of the resulting array.
