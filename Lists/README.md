Given a list, return a tuple with:
- The index where the sequence of most repeated items starts
- The size of the sequence
Example: <br> `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3] -> (2, 3)` <br>
Solution: `mostRepInSeq.py`. <br> Takes input one line at a time at stops when
input is 0.

## Reverse
Given a list, return the list reversed without using the `.reverse()` method. <br>
Solution: `reverse.py`, `reverse2.py` or `reverse3.py`. <br> Takes input one
